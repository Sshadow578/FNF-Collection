3. Game Selection Navigation
4. Warnings, Bugs, and Concerns
5. Credits and Contact Information

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this README, you'll find credits towards the mods included, instructions, and general tips you may need to know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.

The first thing I will talk about is the Instructions on how you can use
this Collection with ease. So, when you are done unpacking the zip file
this thing came in, you'll be greeted with a few different files. The
first thing you'll want to do is double click the file named:
"FridayNightFunkin2-Regular.ttf"

You will be prompted with a menu, but you just want to locate the "Install" button and click it. It will install, and once it's finished, all you have to do is close the window. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.

Now, you will need to double click "fnfcollection.exe". Doing this, it'll prompt you with a windowed menu that has the Friday Night Funkin' Collection logo, along with text options:
"Game Select" and "Settings and Jukebox"

Selecting "Settings and Jukebox", you'll find three options:
"Play BGM, Mute BGM, and Open README"

Pressing Play BGM will start the Background Music back up again or will turn it on after it's been muted. Pressing Mute BGM will stop the Background Music from playing, and Pressing Open README, you'll be lead to this document. On the bottom of your screen, you'll find a Back button and a Jukebox button.

Pressing Back will lead you to the previous menu you've been on, as it's the same case with the rest of the collection. Pressing Jukebox will lead you to the Jukebox menu, where you will find a variety of Song Names. All you'll have to do is click on one and the song will start playing. To stop the music, press the "Stop Music" button under the album art picture.

Pressing the Next button on the Jukebox Menu will lead you to more tracks to listen to, with the same controls as the previous. You may press the Menu button to be taken back to the main menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. 

Once you are back at the Main Menu, or if you've not gone through the Settings and Jukebox menu, you will want to press the "Game Select" button to get to Game and the Mods. 

You will be greeted by a new menu that has a large Friday Night Funkin' logo, and a "Back" and "Mods" button on the bottom. We will come back the Logo in a second, but pressing "Back" brings you back to the Main Menu, and pressing "Mods" will let you access the included Mods in this collection.

So you will be greeted with 2 images detailing the mod that is selectable (IE: First Mod Page will have "Vs. Whitty" and "Vs. Tricky"). Pressing "Next" will lead you to the next page, and any other Mod Page that isn't the first, the "Back" button will lead you to the mod page before it. 

So if you clicked the Friday Night Funkin' Logo, or one of the image icons detailing a mod, you'll be taken to another page with two different options and information. 

The title of the mod will be at the top, a logo from the mod (or a custom designed logo to showcase the mod) will show up right under it, along with some information. The Date Published is the earliest update made on the Gamebanana page, the Developer details the person who uploaded the Mod to Gamebanana, and the Version is the version currently included onto Friday Night Funkin' Collection. 

Under those bits of info, there is also a custom short description of the mod to help give you a better idea of what's going on, or to inform you more about the mod.

Now, there will be two buttons you can click, "Back" and "Play". Pressing Back will lead you out of the Mod Page menu and will let you select other mods, but Pressing Play will launch the mod. The program will now run in the background as then you are able to play the mod.

I DO NOT CLAIM OWNERSHIP OVER ANY MODS INCLUDED, NOR DO I CLAIM OWNERSHIP OF THE FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN ORIGINAL SOUND TRACK AND THE FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN GAME. CREDITS TO THE MOD CREATORS CAN BE FOUND FURTHER DOWN IN THIS DOCUMENT, AND THE ORIGINAL FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN' GAME WAS CREATED BY NINJAMUFFIN99, PHANTOMARCADE, EVILSK8R, KAWAISPRITE, AND ANYBODY ELSE INVOLVED IN CREATING THE GAME. THE FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN ORIGINAL SOUND TRACK BELONGS TO KAWAI SPRITE, AND PLEASE DO SUPPORT HIM ON HIS BANDCAMP AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIAS VIA THE CREDITS SECTION

For bugs, there isn't a lot. This program is Windows only from my tests, so running it on other operating systems won't prove fruitful. Currently, when you back out of a mod on a Mod Info Page, the music will reset and play again, despite if you've pressed the "Mute BGM". I have not been able to find a way where you are able to negate this, but I personally don't find it a large enough issue to worry myself about it. Also, the music does carry on from the Jukebox to the rest of the menu's until reset via the "Back Button" bug or pressing the "Stop Music" or "Mute BGM" buttons.

For concerns, most of them will be calmed here. The program itself is Lightweight, so it won't drastically impact your computer performance, letting you continue to run other programs well it's open. All of the data contained for this collection can be found in the Assets folder, so if something may not be working, checking there will be your best bet. If you are worrying I am stealing from other people's work, please do check the Credits section to find proper credit.
